# Walking-Dogs
School project of a short First Person game made in Unity which I programmed for.

It's a very simple  and basic horror walking sim.

To play the game youÂ´ll need the executable file, the UnityPlayer.dll and extract the Walking Dogs Data folder from the compressed RAR file. All placed in the same directory.
