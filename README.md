# Walking-Dogs
School project of a short First Person game made in Unity which I programmed for.

It's a very simple  and basic horror walking sim.

To play the game youÂ´ll need the executable file, the UnityPlayer.dll and extract the Walking Dogs Data folder from the compressed RAR file. All placed in the same directory.

All of the games code is in the scripts from the Scripts folder, do note that as it was made in Unity functions of it are used. Apologies if it is messy, I rushed through alot and I still have much to learn.
